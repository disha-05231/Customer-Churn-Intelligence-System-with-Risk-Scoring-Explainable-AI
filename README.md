This project builds an end-to-end Customer Churn Intelligence System using real-world telecom data (~100K customers) to predict churn risk and support retention decisions. Churn was defined using business logic (zero revenue in Month 9), followed by exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and preprocessing (handling missing values, class imbalance, and numeric feature selection). A Logistic Regression baseline was developed, then a Random Forest model was trained to capture non-linear behavior patterns, achieving ROC-AUC ≈ 0.92 on leakage-free test data. Predictions were converted into actionable Low / Medium / High risk segments, and customer-level outputs were generated for operational use.

A key learning in this project was identifying and fixing data leakage when unrealistically perfect results appeared. By analyzing feature importance, future Month-9 variables were removed, ensuring realistic model performance. The final system scores the entire customer base, produces prioritized churn lists, highlights top churn drivers using feature importance (Explainable AI), and exports business-ready CSV files for retention teams. The project emphasizes not just modeling, but building a reusable, explainable, and deployment-ready ML pipeline with careful validation and real-world considerations.
